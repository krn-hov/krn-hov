Hi! This here contains some of the projects and assignments I've worked on over the years
Back from when I was an actuarial mathematics student, just beginning to teach myself machine learning
To projects given in my data science master's studies at the University of Helsinki
And even some of the research work I've done (whatever I can disclose ðŸ˜‰)

I'm interested in using data science to contribute to novel, multidisciplinary ideas.
